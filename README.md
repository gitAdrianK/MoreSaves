## More Saves

### Automatic Saves
This mod saves along your play automatically and creates savefiles you can load from the modmenu.
The automated saves are limited to one per map and reflect the state of the last time you have played in that map.
Should you choose to "Give up" deleting the save that Jump King creates so will the automatic save be deleted.

### Manual Saves
Manual saves can be made from the pausemenu and will have the name of the map as well as the timestamp.
It is recommended to rename the folder of the manual save to a more descriptive name.
